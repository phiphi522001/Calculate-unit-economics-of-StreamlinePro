# Calculate the unit economics of Streamline Pro tool

Streamline Pro is a comprehensive project management and collaboration tool designed to help businesses manage projects, track progress, and collaborate effectively. Developed by TechStream Solutions.

TechStream Solutions has been operating for several years and has gathered significant data on their costs and revenues. They are now looking to analyze their unit economics to understand the profitability of Streamline Pro on a per-customer basis.

## Project objectives

This project aims to calculate the unit economics of the Streamline Pro tool in March 2023. This involves analysing key metrics such as Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), Gross Margin, Customer Lifetime Value (LTV), and the LTV/CAC ratio.

By performing these calculations, TechStream Solutions aims to:

- Identify the profitability of acquiring and retaining customers.
- Assess the efficiency of their marketing and sales strategies.
- Make informed decisions on scaling their operations and optimizing their resource allocation.
- This information will guide TechStream Solutions in refining their business strategies, ensuring sustainable growth, and maximizing profitability.

## Resources used
### Datasets 

The datasets are contained in the **"TechStreamData"** folder:

- **Monthly expenses:** contains data on the company's monthly expenses for items such as server costs, software licenses, office rent, etc.
- **Payroll:** contains data on employee salaries in each department each month.
- **daily_marketing_spendings:** contains data on daily marketing expenses on different web platforms.
- **receipts_history:** contains data on past receipts from customers, including a column to mark whether the customer is a new customer.
- **customer_lifespan_data:** contains data on the customer's lifecycle when using the product, including the date they started using and when they left.

## Calculation results

A LTV/CAC ratio exceeding 1 signifies that TechStream Solutions is generating more revenue from customers than it spends on acquiring them. This is a favorable indicator, suggesting sustainable growth and profitability.

While the optimal LTV/CAC ratio generally falls between 3 and 5, indicating a healthy equilibrium between customer acquisition costs and the value derived from customers, TechStream Solutions should aim to enhance this ratio towards the ideal range by exploring strategies to increase LTV and decrease CAC.

Given the average lifespan of TechStream Solution's customers is merely 9.81 months, the company should seek solutions to extend this duration to elevate the LTV and LTV/CAC ratios.
